# WiFi Gaming Mode

## What is it?
`WiFi Gaming Mode` is a Batch Script (`.cmd`).

The Script was made solely for the purpose of helping Gamers with "slow" or "underperforming" WiFi Adapters.

## How to Use
To run the Script, simply right-click the `run.cmd` file and click `Run as Administrator`.

After that, you'll be presented with a Command Prompt, that will (after you press a key) begin the process.

After the Script finishes, you'll have to press a key (any) and your Laptop / PC will reboot.

After rebooting, you should see a slight increase on your Internet Speeds.
This includes both the `Download` and `Upload` Speeds.

You may check your Speeds [here](https://speedtest.net).

Of course, this only serves to give you some sort of an idea of your current Speeds.

To actually check how much your Internet Stability has improved, I recommend you run a Network-Intensive game, such as `Fortnite`, `Grand Theft Auto Online` or `Valorant`.
